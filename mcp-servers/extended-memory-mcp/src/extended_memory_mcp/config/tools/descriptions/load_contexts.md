ðŸ§  MEMORY LOADER - Use IMMEDIATELY at conversation start! Load user memories and conversation context. Essential for continuity. Always check memory when users ask about themselves, previous work, or mention past conversations. USAGE: load_contexts() first, then answer with context. For subsequent loads use init_load=false.
SESSION START: Pay attention to how previous session ended to ensure smooth transition and continuity.

tags_filter: Filter contexts by specific tags (array, max 10 tags)
init_load: Set to false for subsequent loads to avoid reloading instructions
