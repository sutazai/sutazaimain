### 4. Requirements Traceability

#### `create_traceability_matrix`
Creates comprehensive requirements traceability matrix with full bidirectional tracking.

**Traceability Hierarchy:**
```
Business Requirements (from PRD)
    ↓ derives_from
Functional Requirements (Features)
    ↓ derives_from
Use Cases (Actor-Goal-Scenario)
    ↓ implements
Implementation Tasks
```

## Requirements Traceability

### Complete Hierarchy

The system provides end-to-end traceability through four levels:

1. **Business Requirements**: Extracted from PRD objectives and success metrics
2. **Functional Requirements**: Features that implement business requirements
3. **Use Cases**: Actor-goal-scenario structures derived from user stories
4. **Implementation Tasks**: Specific development tasks that implement use cases

### Traceability Links

- **DERIVES_FROM**: Child requirements derive from parent requirements
- **IMPLEMENTS**: Tasks implement requirements/use cases
- **VERIFIES**: Test cases verify requirements
- **DEPENDS_ON**: Dependency relationships
- **CONFLICTS_WITH**: Conflict identification
- **RELATES_TO**: General relationships

### Coverage Analysis

The system provides comprehensive coverage metrics:

- **Business Requirements Coverage**: % of requirements with implementing features
- **Feature Coverage**: % of features with use cases
- **Use Case Coverage**: % of use cases with implementing tasks
- **Task Traceability**: % of tasks linked to requirements
- **Orphaned Task Detection**: Tasks without requirement links
- **Unimplemented Requirements**: Requirements without implementing tasks

## Best Practices

### 1. PRD Generation
- Provide detailed project ideas (minimum 20 characters, ideally 100+)
- Include specific target users and stakeholders
- Set realistic timelines and complexity levels
- Use industry context for better AI analysis
- Enable research for competitive analysis when needed

### 2. Task Generation
- Start with well-structured PRDs for better task quality
- Use appropriate maxTasks limits (20-50 for most projects)
- Enable subtasks for complex features
- Set target complexity thresholds based on team experience
- Always create traceability matrices for enterprise projects

### 3. Requirements Traceability
- Maintain bidirectional links between all requirement levels
- Regularly validate traceability completeness
- Address orphaned tasks and unimplemented requirements promptly
- Use traceability for impact analysis when requirements change
- Track verification status for compliance requirements

### 4. Team Collaboration
- Match task recommendations to team skills
- Consider sprint capacity when getting next task recommendations
- Use complexity analysis before starting high-risk tasks
- Break down tasks with complexity > 7 into subtasks
- Maintain lifecycle tracking for progress visibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Provider Errors
```
Error: No AI providers available
```
**Solution**: Ensure at least one AI provider API key is configured in environment variables.

#### Rate Limiting
```
Error: Rate limit exceeded for provider
```
**Solution**: The system automatically switches to fallback providers. Wait for rate limits to reset or configure additional providers.

#### Invalid PRD Content
```
Error: Failed to extract features from PRD
```
**Solution**: Ensure PRD content is well-structured with clear sections for objectives, features, and requirements.

#### Traceability Gaps
```
Warning: 15 orphaned tasks detected
```
**Solution**: Review orphaned tasks and link them to appropriate requirements or use cases. Consider if tasks are truly necessary.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use appropriate task limits**: Don't generate more tasks than needed
2. **Enable caching**: AI responses are cached to improve performance
3. **Batch operations**: Use traceability matrix creation for bulk operations
4. **Monitor API usage**: Track AI provider usage to avoid unexpected costs

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=ai-services:*
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

This provides detailed information about:
- AI provider selection and fallback
- Request/response cycles
- Traceability link generation
- Coverage analysis calculations
